## ⚠️ Notes for Backend Developer

All components expect the API responses to match the format defined in `DASHBOARD_API_GUIDE.md`. Key requirements:

### Response Format
All API responses should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { /* actual data */ }
}
```

### Date Format
All dates should be in ISO 8601 format:
```
"2025-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"
```

### File Uploads
- Use `multipart/form-data` encoding
- Accept files in FormData with key "file" or "files"
- Return file metadata in response

### Error Responses
Should include:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message"
  }
}
```
