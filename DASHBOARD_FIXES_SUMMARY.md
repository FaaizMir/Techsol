### Issue 8: Profile - Data Display
**Status:** ✅ Verified Working

**Analysis:**
The ProfileSection component is already properly implemented with dynamic data:

✅ **Correct Implementation:**
- All inputs use `value={formData.field}` with controlled state (not `defaultValue`)
- Profile data is fetched from API using `useProfile()` hook
- `useEffect` properly updates form state when profile data loads
- All mutation hooks are properly connected:
  - `useUpdateProfile()` for profile updates
  - `useUpdateProfilePicture()` for picture upload
  - `useChangePassword()` for password changes
- Loading state with spinner while fetching data
- Proper error handling with try-catch blocks

**No changes needed** - component is already fully functional with real API data.

**Files Verified:**
- `src/components/dashboard/ProfileSection.tsx`
